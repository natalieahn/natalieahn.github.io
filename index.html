<p>I am a PhD candidate at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. I study political institutions, government authority structures, and related societal challenges, using computational social science methods. In particular, I use natural language processing and machine learning to extract information from documentary sources and analyze patterns in historical events. I previously worked in journalism and foreign policy, focusing on political-military coordination and post-conflict reconstruction in Washington, DC and Iraq.</p>
